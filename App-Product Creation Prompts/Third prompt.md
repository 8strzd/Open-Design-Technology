You are a united nations volunteer specializing in filtration technologies, create a solution for the 6th sdg which is Clean Water and Sanitation, focus on creating a tangible product and write a small pitch explaining the idea

🧩 The Product: AquaPod
AquaPod is a modular, solar-powered community water filtration and sanitation unit designed for underserved rural and peri-urban communities. It delivers safe drinking water, basic sanitation linkage, and hygiene access through a single, compact system.
🔧 How AquaPod Works (Product Breakdown)
1️⃣ Filtration Core (Clean Water)

Stage 1: Sediment filter (removes sand, silt, debris)
Stage 2: Activated carbon (removes odor, chemicals)
Stage 3: Ultrafiltration membrane / UV chamber (kills pathogens)

Solar-powered pump ensures off-grid functionality

📦 Output: 500–1,000 liters/day of WHO-standard potable water

2️⃣ Smart Dispensing Module

Foot-pedal or tap-based dispensing (hygienic, low-contact)

Prepaid / subsidized card or token system

Built-in water quality indicator (green/red LED)

3️⃣ Sanitation Linkage Unit

Connects to eco-toilets or handwashing stations

Greywater reused for flushing or irrigation

Optional bio-digester attachment for waste treatment

4️⃣ Modular & Repairable Design

Components are plug-and-play

Filters replaceable by trained local operators

Compact enough to be installed in:

Schools

Community centers

Health clinics

Relief camps
